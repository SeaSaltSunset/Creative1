	<h1>About</h1>

	<p> The Sword and Soul Project is a new effort started by a bunch of nerdy college kids  <br>
	who enjoy looking at sharp pieces of metal to expensive for them to buy. We, well okay, I, <br>
	have been "playing" with swords ever since I was a kid and, although I may never use one in combat <br>
	I believe that swordsmanship is a hobby anybody can enjoy. To raise awareness, I set up this small <br>
	personality quiz website. Hopefully, it's gotten you and your friends a little more curious about the <br>
	world of swords. We don't have much here on the sight yet, but are continually expanding our collection. <br>  
	Come back later to take the test again, and maybe by then we'll have added a new sword that matches you <br>
	even better than the last. See ya around, and <br> 
	look sharp!
